`My80sAccCreateModal` is an 80's computer styled account creation modal that is comprised of 3 inputs (username, email, password), and a button. This component takes 2 props, one is the title text to be displayed at the top of the form, and the second is a callback function that will send the current controlled state of the form inputs back to a parent component for use.

`My80sAccLoginModal` takes the same props as `My80sAccCreateModal`. The only difference is that instead of 3 form input fields, it only has 2: 'username', and 'password'; but doesn't include the email field.
